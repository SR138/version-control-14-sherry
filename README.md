# version-control-14
this is the version control repository

In this project a user is asked to input their name, favorite class, and the grade they have in that class. After, the code prints out the said information in a print statement.

We chose to use this license as it is a strong support of community building and sense of freedom in the code. This license is more about the freedom of expression in your code than the price that people need to pay to use our code.

We made the code of conduct and added that specific license because it creates a strong sense of community. By limiting certain words and phrases in the user input section of our code allows us to create a new, community foucsed program that is open to communication and togetherness. We also chose to include that specific punishment to show how important the guidlines are for people to follow.
